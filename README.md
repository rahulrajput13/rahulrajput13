## Hi, I'm Rahul Rajput

I'm a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in end-to-end analytics — from ingesting large-scale, real-time data streams to deploying robust statistical and machine learning models that drive business impact.

Most recently, I worked at **Wiliot**, where I built ML and analytics pipelines to track the movement of over 100 million objects annually across 1,000+ retail and logistics sites. I contributed to modeling architecture (Bayesian Markov models, Kalman Filters), built national-scale dashboards, and developed infrastructure-aware experiments and KPI libraries used across product teams.

I hold a **Master’s in Business Analytics from UC Davis**, where I was inducted into **Beta Gamma Sigma** for academic excellence. My prior background includes an Engineering degree from the **University of Oxford**, with early roles in analytics consulting, product strategy, and public policy.
