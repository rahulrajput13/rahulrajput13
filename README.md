ðŸŽ“ **Hi there, I'm Rahul!** 

I just graduated with my Masters in Business Analytics from UC Davis where I was recognized by the academic honor society Beta Gamma Sigma for my academic performance during the program. I'm currently looking for roles as a Business/Data Analyst or Data Engineer! 

I have work experience in diverse settings - State, Startup, and Consulting helping build, manage, and deliver multiple projects and products. The most fun aspect for me in all these experiences was where I got to work with data and building out insghts. This inspired me to make a switch into the field of Data. It has been a little over a year since I started my journey and I've grown and learnt a lot.

Aside from work I love learning about anything and everything under thew sun, spending significant time on platforms like Quora, Nautilus, Wired, etc. Last book read - 'Your Inner Fish' by Neil Shubin.
