ðŸŽ“ **Hi there, I'm Rahul!** 

I just graduated with my Masters in Business Analytics from UC Davis where I was recognized by the academic honor society Beta Gamma Sigma for my academic performance during the program. I'm currently looking for roles in the field of Data -  Business/Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist! (Open to Full-Time & Internship positions)

A bit about my journey so far - I did my undergrad in Engineering, with a focus on Biomedical Eng, from the University of Oxford. I had planned to pursue a career in the field but, unfortunately, I was part of the class graduating in 2020. The Biomedical Dept shifted its focus to the production of the Astrazeneca Vaccine and I was unable to pursue my Masters Degree. Fortunately, I had gained experience working with data during my time, so I joined a Consulting Firm - with a focus on Analytics + Product Development. I realised I quite enjoyed working with Data so I decided to pursue a Masters in the field to formalise my skills. Now, here I am, excited to use my now professional education in the Real World!

I love the entire process of building end to end projects - working on the Data Engineering part to the Data Analytics part, I would call myself a Full-Stack Data Analyst at this point!

Aside from work I love learning about anything and everything under thew sun, spending significant time on platforms like Quora, Nautilus, Wired, etc. Last book read - 'Your Inner Fish' by Neil Shubin.
